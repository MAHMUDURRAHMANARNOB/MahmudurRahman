  title: "About Me",
  description: `I’m Mahmudur Rahman, a dedicated Mobile Application Developer with over 3 years of experience, currently shaping innovative EdTech solutions at Shonod in Dhaka, Bangladesh. My passion lies in crafting seamless, user-friendly mobile apps using Flutter, Java-Kotlin, and modern tools like Firebase and Supabase. I specialize in integrating RESTful APIs, designing intuitive UI/UX with Figma, and ensuring top-notch performance—evidenced by my apps’ 4.5+ star ratings on Google Play Store.

My journey began at the American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB), where I earned a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering with a CGPA of 3.36. Since then, I’ve led impactful projects like Study Room, Risho-Speech, and TalentLensHub, increasing user engagement by 30% and achieving a 99% crash-free rate. I thrive on creating clean, scalable code and delivering designs that enhance user retention by 25% through engaging and modern interfaces.

When I’m not coding, I’m exploring new technologies or refining my craft to build solutions that make a difference. My goal is to combine technical excellence with user-centric design to create apps that empower and inspire.`,
